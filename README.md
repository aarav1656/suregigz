## ❌ Problem Statement

Traditional freelancing platforms suffer from systemic issues:
- **Mismatched Expectations:** Lack of clarity and trust leads to dissatisfaction over deliverables.
- **Unfair Dispute Handling:** Centralized platforms often have opaque dispute resolution processes that favor one side.
- **Payment Insecurity:** Freelancers are at risk of non-payment or delayed payments.
- **Verification Challenges:** Difficult to accurately assess freelancer skills or verify expertise.
- **Centralized Control:** Central entities arbitrate disputes and manage data, leading to low transparency.

## ✅ SureGigz Solution

SureGigz solves these issues with a decentralized, technical approach:

### 🔐 Attestation-Based Agreements
- Smart contracts define and store job terms (deliverables, timelines, milestones, etc.).
- Terms are immutable and verifiable, ensuring transparency for both parties.

### 🤖 AI-Powered Work Evaluation
- AI models assess the quality and relevance of submitted work by comparing it with the job description.
- A relevance score provides an objective metric.

### 🧑‍⚖️ Decentralized Dispute Resolution
- In case of disputes, outcome is determined through decentralized voting, ensuring fairness and transparency.
- Voters are verified using ZKPass, proving identity and reputation without revealing sensitive data.
- AI provides an initial assessment, which voters consider alongside submitted evidence.


### 💸 Escrow-Backed Payments
- Clients deposit payment into a smart contract escrow at project start.
- Funds are released automatically upon successful validation of submitted work.

### 📤 Intent-Based Automation with NEAR
- SureGigz integrates NEAR Intents to simplify complex interactions like payment release.
- Clients and AI agents can express high-level goals (e.g., "release payment" or "swap tokens") without handling transactions manually.
- A Solver Network competes to execute these intents optimally, abstracting away cross-chain and execution complexity.
